# Image-Compression-with-Vector-Quantization
This repository is about compressed image with vector quantization technique. It begins from generating codebook with Linde-Buzo-Grey (LBG) algorithm, encode and decode the image, also some experiments to analyze the effect of parameters.
## This repository ispired by :
LBG Algorithm (only): https://mkonrad.net/projects/gen_lloyd.html
However seems like the implementation is slower for the image, therefore recoded again in python also many changes have been done to make it faster especially integrate with python numpy operation.

## Usage
When doing simulation make sure you deleting all .csv file in simulation folder.
