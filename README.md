# Image-Compression-with-Vector-Quantization
This repository is about compressed image with vector quantization technique. It begins from generating codebook with Linde-Buzo-Grey (LBG) algorithm, encode and decode the image, also some experiments to analyze the effect of parameters.
## This repository ispired by :
LBG Algorithm (only): https://github.com/internaut/py-lbg 
However seems like the code in here is slower for the image, therefore many amandement have been done to make it faster especially integrate with numpy operation.

## Usage
When doing simulation make sure you deleting all .csv file in simulation folder.
